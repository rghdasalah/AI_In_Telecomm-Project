AI in Telecommunications â€“ Time Series Forecasting Project

ðŸ“˜ Overview:

This project addresses real-world telecommunications challenges using deep learning and advanced time series forecasting techniques. The system is designed to extract actionable insights from complex network datasets, detect anomalies, and enhance reliability through root cause analysis and predictive modeling.

ðŸ§  Key Features:

Time Series Forecasting with SARIMAX and Prophet

Anomaly Detection and Change Point Detection

Root Cause Analysis for network issues

Seasonality Detection using Fourier Transform and STL Decomposition

Stationarity Check using ADF Test

Z-Score Based Outlier Handling

Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning (Missing Values, Outliers)

Seasonal Interpolation and Historical Mean Modeling

Harmonic Terms Integration for complex seasonal patterns

Train Window History (Min/Max) based evaluation
